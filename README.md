## Overview

ComplianceGuardEngine is a powerful tool designed to ensure code compliance and maintain code quality through static
code analysis. It empowers developers and project owners to proactively detect and address code violations, promoting
best practices and enhancing the overall software development process.

## Features

- **Static Code Analysis:** Perform in-depth static code analysis to identify potential violations and issues in your
  codebase.

- **Violation Notifications:** Automatically notify code owners and relevant stakeholders when violations are detected,
  enabling quick resolution.

- **Custom Rules:** Define and customize code compliance rules to align with your project's specific coding standards.

- **Integration:** Seamlessly integrate ComplianceGuardEngine into your development workflow using APIs and plugins.

- **Dashboard:** Visualize code compliance metrics and trends through an intuitive dashboard, gaining insights into code quality. Cloud Qunie is the first-generation Angular-based Dashboard for the Compliance Guard Engine solution, still under continuous development.

> Note: You can check in the `admin-console` directory and simply run `npm i` and `npm start` commands to start the server.
